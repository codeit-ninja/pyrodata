* Toluene  is an EPA Not Classifiable as to Human Carcinogenicity and an IARC Not Classifiable as to Carcinogemicity to Humans.
**Tetrachloromethane   Chlorinated rubbers contain residual levels of tightly-bound  Tetrachloromethane.  This Tetrachloromethane is not released from the solid chlorinated rubber at ambient temperatures.  It can be released at elevated temperatures and when dissolved in solvents.

<tr><td colspan="5"><h1>Section III Hazards Identification:</h1>

<ul>
	<li><span class="emph">Accute Health Effects:</span>&nbsp Irritating to the skin and eyes 
	on contact.  Inhalation will cause irritation to the lungs and mucus membrane.  Irritation 
	to the eyes will cause watering and redness.  Reddening, scaling, and itching are 
	characteristics of skin inflammation.  Follow safe industrial hygiene practices and 
	always wear protective equipment when handling this compound.
	<li><span class="emph">Chronic Health Effects:</span>&nbsp This product has no known chronic effects.  
	Repeated or prolong exposure to this compound is not known to aggravate medical conditions.

	<li><span class="emph">Fire/Explosion Hazards:</span>&nbsp Under certain combustion conditions could form respiratory irritants such as phosgene, hydrogen chloride, chlorinated acids, aldehydes, ketones, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.  
</ul>
<h1>Section VI.  Accidental Release Measures</h1>
<ul>
	<li><span class="emph">Spill Or Leak Procedures:</span>&nbspUtilize recommended 
	protective clothing and equipment.  Clean spills in a manner that does not disperse 
	dust into the air.  Spill area can be washed with water.  Collect wash water for 
	approved disposal.  Keep from entering water or ground water
</ul>
<h1>Section VII.  Handling and Storage</h1>
<ul>
	<li><span class="emph">Storage Temperatures:</span>&nbsp Store at ambient temperature
	<li><span class="emph">Shelf Life:</span>&nbspUnlimited in tightly closed container.
